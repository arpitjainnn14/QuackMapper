# QuackMapper
The goal of this project is to visually represent earthquake data on a geographical map to provide insights into seismic activity patterns. Utilizing the Folium library, the project visualizes earthquake data on a world map. It reads data from a CSV file and plots markers at the locations of recorded earthquakes.
